		<p>Hello, friends! my name is Belisy.: ) I just started studing developers. So I think it takes a little longer to learn than others. That's why assignment is a little later than I thought. I'm sorry i turned in the assignment late. I will study harder as I am still lacking a lot. Let's all work hard and get a job wherever we want. Let's all cheer up!</p>
